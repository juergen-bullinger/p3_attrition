# This is done in ingestion.py

##################Checking for model drift
# check whether the score from the deployed model is different from the score 
# from the model that uses the newest ingested data


##################Deciding whether to proceed, part 2
# if you found model drift, you should proceed. otherwise, do end the process
# here



##################Re-deployment
# if you found evidence for model drift, re-run the deployment.py script

##################Diagnostics and reporting
# run diagnostics.py and reporting.py for the re-deployed model
